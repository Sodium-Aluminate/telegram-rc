We have discovered that some improper configured network devices can cause the connection to 1.1.1.1 via DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to fail. If you could not connect to `api.telegram.org` while we working on a fix, you can turn off DoH temporarily.

**There may be unknown bugs in the pre-release version,Please use at your own risk.**
